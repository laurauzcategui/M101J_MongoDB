Please calculate the average population of cities in California (abbreviation CA) and New York (NY) (taken together) with populations over 25,000. 

For this problem, assume that a city name that appears in more than one state represents two separate cities. 

Please round the answer to a whole number. 
Hint: The answer for CT and NJ (using this data set) is 38177. 

Please note:
Different states might have the same city name.
A city might have multiple zip codes.
